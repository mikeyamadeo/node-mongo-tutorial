# node-mongo-tutorial
We will be building off of serving data from a server using node and introduce how we can persist data with a database using mongodb.

We will cover:

1. How to connect to mongodb
2. How to insert data into mongodb
3. How to retrieve data from mongodb

Before we do this, let's get up and running.


## Pre-reqs

- Node w/ npm must be installed. If that is not the case, learn how [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- MongoDB must be installed. If that is not the case, learn how [here](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/)

## Up and Running

##### 1. Clone repo
Make sure to clone this repository

##### 2. Run the server
We can make sure our server is running by executing the following in the terminal

`node api-server.js`

If we go to port /index.html on port 4000 we should see a red screen instructing us to set up our endpoint. If you are using your local machine you would go to [http://localhost:4000/index.html](http://localhost:4000/index.html)

`git clone https://github.com/mikeyamadeo/node-mongo-tutorial.git`

##### 3. Start MongoDB
If mongodb is installed, we should run the following in the terminal to get mongodb running

`mongod`

## Connecting to MongoDB

##### 1. Get access to MongoDB in our javascript
We will need to use npm here to install the javascript library that helps us communicate with mongodb. npm is a package manager that allows us to retrieve javascript code from internet and download it to our projects using the terminal. The way we can install the javascript library for mongodb:

making sure you are in the root directory of the application, execute the following in your terminal

`npm install mongodb`

What should of happened is a `node_modules` directory should have showed up and inside you should see a `mongodb` directory.

Now, in our `api-server.js` file, right below the comment that reads `var mongodb = require('mongodb');`, let's include the following line of code:

```js
var mongodb = require('mongodb');
```

What this does is instruct node to look for a library named `mongodb`. After looking within node's library of modules and not finding one, it will be smart enough to look in our `node_modules` directory and find it there.

##### 2. Open a connection

Next we will open a connection to mongodb using our snazzy new javascript library. Feel free to paste the following right underneath where we declare the `mongodb` variable.

```js
// We need to work with "MongoClient" interface in order to connect to a mongodb server.
var MongoClient = mongodb.MongoClient;

// Connection URL. This is where your mongodb server is running.
var dbUrl = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/pokemon';

// we will use this variable later to insert and retrieve a "collection" of data
var collection

// Use connect method to connect to the Server
MongoClient.connect(dbUrl, function (err, db) {
  if (err) {
    console.log('Unable to connect to the mongoDB server. Error:', err);
  } else {
    // HURRAY!! We are connected. :)
    console.log('Connection established to', dbUrl);
    
    /**
     * TODO: insert data here, once we've successfully connected
     */
  }
});

```

Go ahead and run `node api-server.js` in your terminal again, and you should expect to see the `connection established` log.

## Inserting data

##### 1. Make a 'pokemon' collection
Let's put that collection variable we already declared to work. Notice that in the callback funciont we provided to `MongoClient.connect`, we expect to receive a `db` variable. We will use that to create a `pokemon` collection like so:

```js
collection = db.collection('pokemon');
```
##### 2. Insert data
Now we will use that collection object to insert the array `pokemon` like so:

```js
// do some work here with the database.
collection = db.collection('pokemon');

collection.insert(pokemon, function (err, result) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
  } else {
    console.log('Inserted %d documents into the "pokemon" collection. The documents inserted with "_id" are:', result.length, result);
  }
  
  // Close connection
  db.close()
}
```

All said and done our code connecting to the db and inserting our array of pokemon into the database should look something like the following:

```js
// Use connect method to connect to the Server
MongoClient.connect(dbUrl, function (err, db) {
  if (err) {
    console.log('Unable to connect to the mongoDB server. Error:', err);
  } else {
    // HURRAY!! We are connected. :)
    console.log('Connection established to', dbUrl);

    // do some work here with the database.
    collection = db.collection('pokemon');
    collection.insert(pokemon, function (err, result) {
      if (err) {
        console.log(err);
      } else {
        console.log('Inserted %d documents into the "pokemon" collection. The documents inserted with "_id" are:', result.length, result);
      }

      // Close connection
      db.close();
    })
  }
});
```

If we run `node api-server.js` we should expect a log telling us we have an established connection, and a log informing us we've inserted documents.

## Retrieving data

Sadly, if we look in our browser, we still only see red. That's because we aren't returning any data when the pathname is `/pokemon`. We want to return this data from the mongo database.

##### 1. Define callback that will receive data from the db

Inside the callback function where we create our server, underneat the `TODO` comment, let's add the following optimistic funciton:

```js

/**
 * TODO: return pokemon data stored in mongodb
 */

getPokemonFromDb(function (data) {
  res.writeHead(200)
  res.end(JSON.stringify(data))
})

```
This will throw an error if we try to run it because we haven't defined a function named `getPokemonFromDb`. It is good practice though to define _how_ you want to use code you haven't written yet. This promotes better quality code.

##### 2. Define `getPokemonFromDb`

Just above the line with `http.createServer` let's place the following:

```js
function getPokemonFromDb (donOnSuccess) {
  MongoClient.connect(dbUrl, function (err, db) {

    if (err) {
      console.log('Unable to connect to the mongoDB server. Error:', err);
    } else {

      // Get the documents collection
      var collection = db.collection('pokemon');

      // Get all pokemon from mongodb
      collection.find({}).toArray(function (err, result) {
        if (err) {
          console.log(err);
        } else if (result.length) {
          donOnSuccess(result)
        } else {
          console.log('No document(s) found with defined "find" criteria!');
        }
        // Close connection
        db.close();
      });
    }
  });
}
```

Now if we run our server (`node api-server.js`) and view the results in the browser, we should expect to see a blue screen with our pokemon gifs running in the view. 

NOTE: If you have run `api-server.js` multiple times since adding the code to insert data into mongo, there will be duplicates of the pokemon data. This demonstrates that the data is persisting between server runs. Because we are not removing data, we add our array of pokemon to the previous inserts each time we execute the code. This will result in more and more pokemon showing up every time the `api-server.js` is run.

For additional learning, you can try to clear the pokemon collection before inserting each time. The method for this is `.remove` and would look similar to `.insert`

#### Troubleshooting
If you are having trouble you can see a working version of the code by switching branches on the repository using the terminal:

`git checkout answer`
