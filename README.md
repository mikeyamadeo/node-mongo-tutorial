# node-mongo-tutorial
We will be building off of serving data from a server using node and introduce how we can persist data with a database using mongodb.

We will cover:

1. How to connect to mongodb
2. How to insert data into mongodb
3. How to retrieve data from mongodb

Before we do this, let's get up and running.

## Up and Running

*First*, we must have mongodb installed. Instructions on doing so can be found [here](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/)

*Second*, make sure to clone this repository

`git clone https://github.com/mikeyamadeo/node-mongo-tutorial.git`

*Third*, We can make sure our server is running by running

`node api-server.js`

If we go to port /index.html on port 4000 we should see a red screen instructing us to set up our endpoint. If you are using your local machine you would go to [http://localhost:4000/index.html](http://localhost:4000/index.html)

be sure you have this repository cloned on to your local machine using
