# node-api-server-tutorial
Simple introduction to creating a REST service and api with node


## Running the server

Clone the repository, then run this command in the project directory to run the server with the latest changes you've made to the `api-server.js` file:

```
node api-server.js
```

Now you can access the the app at ([http://localhost:4000/index.html](http://localhost:4000/index.html)).

You should see a red background with instructions to "Set up your endpoint at `/pokemon` to get this view working".

We will do this in the api-server.js file. Our goal is to send back the list of pokemon declared as an array at the top of the file when the UI requests it from the `/pokemon` endpoint. We will know this has worked when a blue screen listing the pokemon shows in our browser.
